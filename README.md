# Awesome Docs

*“Documentation is like sex; when it’s good, it’s very, very good, and when it’s bad, it’s better than nothing.” — Dick Brandon*

Documentation is so often unvalued and overlooked that the hard work, skill and creativity which goes into it goes unrecognised. Inspired by Mark Phillips [Beautiful-Docs repository](https://github.com/PharkMillups/beautiful-docs), I decided to create my own and highlight some docs spaces and sites which are awesome for either their design, layout, content or interactivity. 

## A-Z of Examples
* **[Apiary](https://help.apiary.io/tools/embed/)** - A nice example of interactive documentation.
* **[Bonusly](https://bonusly.gelato.io/docs/versions/353215342023018198)** - Simple and interactive site built using [Gelato.io](https://gelato). What's not to like?
* **[Box](https://developer.box.com/reference)** - An engaging API doc created using [ReadMe](https://readme.io) which offers user interactivity.
* **[Cockroach Labs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/)** - Fun, clean and well-designed.  
* **[Digital Ocean](https://developers.digitalocean.com/documentation/v2/#introduction)** - These docs are great. Full of examples and easy/enjoyable to navigate.
* **[Grafana](http://docs.grafana.org/)** - Unusual dark theme but really like the design and its in keeping with their brand.
* **[Lightrail](https://www.lightrail.com/docs/)** Really nice split screen with interactive section that can switch between example and console views.
* **[Luxbar](https://balzss.github.io/luxbar/)** This docs page demos the flexibility of the product (a CSS navigation bar) as you click around and change the colours, positioning, alignment etc. Very clever.
* **[Mailchimp](http://developer.mailchimp.com/documentation/mailchimp/reference/overview/)** - Aspects of this site are so nicely designed it makes me a bit jealous. The API reference guide in particular.
* **[Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/)** - Very clean docs with nice use of colour.
* **[Monzo](https://monzo.com/docs)** - I'm a big fan of Monzo and like the product, the docs have a great UX design which allows you to scroll effortlessly through the content.
* **[Nest](https://developers.nest.com/documentation/api-reference)** - Very cool interactive API reference from Nest Labs (part of Google).
* **[Rot.js](http://ondras.github.io/rot.js/manual/)** Not necessarily the prettiest but really like the interactive code examples which can be changed. The animated side menu is always pretty cool.
* **[Slack](https://api.slack.com/)** - Colourful and fun with the Slack brand of humour but well designed like the product.
* **[Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/api#intro)** - Stripe go a great job of providing copy-paste ready sample calls in their API reference guide.
* **[Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/)** - Twilio Docs have a really distinctive style with bold headings and colours to denote each section (green for API/SDKs, blue for Quickstart, yellow for tutorials) to make navigation easy. 
* **[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/index.html)** - Simple, clean and easy to navigate. Has a nice search feature which splits the search results.
