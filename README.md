# Awesome Docs
Documentation is so often unvalued and overlooked that the hard work, skill and creativity which goes into it goes unrecognised. Inspired by Mark Phillups [Beautiful-Docs repository](https://github.com/PharkMillups/beautiful-docs), I decided to create my own and highlight some docs spaces and sites which I think are awesome in terms of their design, layout, content and interactivity. 

## A-Z of Examples
* **[Box](https://developer.box.com/reference)** - An API doc with a nice design and interactivity for readers.
* **[Mailchimp](http://developer.mailchimp.com/documentation/mailchimp/reference/overview/)** - Aspects of this site are so nicely designed it makes me a bit jealous. The API reference guide in particular.
* **[Monzo](https://monzo.com/docs)** - I'm a big fan of Monzo and I'm a big fan of their API doc with its beautiful UX/UI design which allows you to scroll effortlessly through the content.
* **[Slack](https://api.slack.com/)** - Colourful and fun but also pleasantly designed like the product.
* **[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/index.html)** - Simple, clean and easy to navigate. Has a nice search feature which splits the search results.
