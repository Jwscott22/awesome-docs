# Awesome Docs A-Z
Documentation is so often unvalued and overlooked that the hard work, skill and creativity which goes into it goes unrecognised. Inspired by Mark Phillups [Beautiful-Docs repository](https://github.com/PharkMillups/beautiful-docs), I decided to create my own and highlight some docs spaces and sites which I think are awesome in terms of their design, layout, content and interactivity. 

## Awesome Examples
* **[Box](https://developer.box.com/reference)** - An API doc with a nice design and interactivity for readers.
* **[Mailchimp](http://developer.mailchimp.com/documentation/mailchimp/reference/overview/)** - Aspects of this site are so nicely designed it makes me a bit jealous. The API reference guide in particular.
* **[Monzo](https://monzo.com/docs)** - I'm a big fan of Monzo and I'm a big fan of their API doc with its beautiful UX/UI design which allows you to scroll effortlessly through the content.
